Mr. Albert Fredman,62,Male,MRN,Inpatient,Cardiology,," The patient is known to me secondary to atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response partially due to medications at least when I first saw him in the office on 011106. He is being seen on the Seventh Floor. The patient is in Room 7607. The patient has a history of recent adenocarcinoma of the duodenum that was found to be inoperable since it engulfed the porta hepatis. He was seen in my office on 011106 for preop evaluation due to leg edema. A nonocclusive DVT was diagnosed in the proximal left superficial femoral vein. An echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50. The patient was admitted to the hospital and treated with a Greenfield filter since anticoagulant was contraindicated. Additional information on the echocardiogram where a grossly dilated left atrium moderately severely dilated right atrium. The rhythm was as stated before atrial fibrillation with slow atrioventricular conduction and an intraventricular conduction delay on the monitor strip. There was mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation mild pulmonic insufficiency. The ejection fraction was considered low normal since it was estimated 50 to 54. The leg edema improved while lying down suggesting that the significant element of venous insufficiency was indeed present. The patient who was diabetic received consultation by Dr R He was also a chronic hypertensive and was treated for that with ACE inhibitors. As a matter of fact they were discontinued. Now the patient denied any shortness of breath or chest pain throughout this hospitalization and cardiac nuclear studies performed earlier demonstrated no reversible ischemia. He is currently walking in the corridor with assistance. He is no longer on fluconazole.

The patient was diagnosed to be suffering from Ventricular Ectopy, Peripheral Artery disease, Coronary Artery disease and Ischemic Cardiomyopathy for which she underwent Right Femoral Popliteal Bypass surgery at 10:15am and was moved to Coronary Care Unit at 11:00am in a stable condition. The patient tolerated the procedure well. No complications.",High,"Enoxaparin 25 mg prn
